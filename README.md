# Password for Web Viewer

This plugin was created following a discussion on the [Obsidian.md forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/restriction-option-for-the-web-viewer-plugin/95810/2). I think it's important that parents can control access to the web browser for their children. This plugin is a first step in adding a password to the web browser.

> [!warning]
> If the plugin is disabled, the web viewer will be accessible. It is more of a proof-of-concept than a real security feature.

## Usage
### ðŸš€ Quick start
First, go to the plugin settings and set a password. By default, the password will be encrypted and saved in your configuration folder (`.obsidian`).

Then, go to the core plugin and enable the web browser. You will be prompted to enter the password.

### Reset the password

To reset the password, go to the plugin settings and set a new password. When you click on `change password`, you will be prompted to enter the old password. Then, you can set a new password.

> [!warning]
> This plugin doesn't store the data in `data.json`. Uninstalling the plugin **doesn't** reset the password.
> If you've forgotten the password, please contact the author via <a href="mailto:support@mara-li.fr">support@mara-li.fr</a> with the subject `[PASSWORD] Password lost`.

    - Translate the content

    - Edit the `ressource` part with adding : `<lang> : {translation: <lang>}`
